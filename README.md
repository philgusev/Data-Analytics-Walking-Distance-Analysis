# Data-Analytics-Walking-Distance-Analysis
In this project I've analysed my daily walking distances and identified that I was not achieving my goal of 10000 steps important to keep myself healthy. Then I offered myself a solution on improving my results based on my findings.
Here is a googlesheets link with some calulations and a chart of my walking distances throughout 1 week period:
